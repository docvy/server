Multi-process plugin architecture

Plugins are a frequent source of instability or crashes for browser
 users. When plugins run in the same process as the browser, any
 leaks or crashes in the plugin will affect the entire browser.

In order to make the browser user experience better, it is possible to
 separate plugin execution from the process in which the browser
 normally executes. When multi-process plugins are enabled, a shim
 layer in the browser implements the plugin API (the NPP_ functions
 which would normally be implemented directly by the plugin). The
 calls are transferred to the plugin process via the IPDL protocol
 language. In the plugin process, the shim layer serves as a plugin
 host, implementing the NPN_ functions used by the plugin, and
 forwards the calls to the plugin DLL.

Multi-process plugins, also called out of process plugins or OOPP first
 shipped in Firefox 3.6.4 on Windows and Linux, and in Firefox 4 on
 Mac OS X.

In addition to crash protection, the multi-process plugin architecture
 allows Firefox to see plugins which respond very slowly or have
 completely stopped responding. For more details on hang protection,
 see the page on the plugin hang detector.
